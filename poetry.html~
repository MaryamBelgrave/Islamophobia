<h3><b>for Deah, or, an oath to a fallen friend			By Toulouse</b></h3>
<pre>
islamophobia
at its finest
you couldn't have spoken truer words
three years before injustice
fell cascading down upon your head
like rocks
each one labeled
hate
fear
terror
and it's that label, drenched in your blood
that begs and screams to be renounced
i am not a terrorist
no,
you aren't, but every pale-skinned man
who doesn't know the pigment in your skin
as anything but dirt
couldn't see the difference
so yet, we fight
for you
your love, your voice
for every child that lives in fear
we will charge on
your skin tone
is not a death sentence
and the media who doesn't know 
their right from their united left
will hear us
we do not need you
we do not need you
we do not need you
us many times as God will give us strength
we will charge on
for you
for them
for Palestine
for Syria
for every fear-filled child
we will remember
and for each one fallen,
trapped beneath the rocks
hate, fear, terror
we will set you free


the truth
i feel sad when people said that
the religion of Islam
is the religion of hate.


i feel sad, and depressed.
i loved everyone around the world
i tried to spread peace
around me and in social medias
because that is what i can only do


but then?


why do you judge
my religion when i know it better
than you do?


why do you hate something
so much
before trying to understand it?


i know my religion
if it promotes hate and revenge
i would already leave this religion


but my religion is purely innocent
i swear to my God
to the earth, and to the sky
that my religion loved peace.


stop this, please. i'm begging you.

<h3><b>When the Prophet Mohammed turned up in Colorado        By Daniel Steven Moskowitz </b></h3>
<pre>
I was so sick
Of all the News,
Especially about this Stupid Presidential Campaign
Between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
And I was so sick
Of all the Stupid, Cliquish,
Snobbish  Ass Holes in Denver
That I decided that I needed to Escape from the World.
So, I found a Secret Cave
High in the Colorado Rockies
On a U.S.G.S. Topographic Map.
I bushwhacked over steep and slippery hills,
And,
After a long, tough hike,
Found the Cave.
When I walked in,
I saw none other than the Prophet Mohammed,
Sitting there praying with his beads.
I said to him, "Hey, dude, Mohammed?"
"What the heck are you doin' here?"
"Muslims don't believe in Reincarnation, do they?"
Mohammed replied to me sharply.
"Moskowitz, who the hell told you that Buddhists"
"Are the only ones capable of Reincarnation?"
"The Dalai Lama?"
"Don't you know"
"That Allah is capable of all things?"
I felt perplexed.
What was  the Prophet  Mohammed doing here in Colorado
With all these Stoners?
"Listen here, Dude," I told him.
"You're supposed to be in Arabia."
"That's what it says in the Qu'ran!"
Mohammed was not discouraged in the slightest
By my Arrogance
To him,
One cave was just the same as another.
"Colorado.....Arabia."
"What difference does it make?"
"All these Categories were created by Human Beings,"
"Not Allah."
Then,
He continued,
Pointing his finger at me while preaching.
"Mr. Moskowitz, this entire World is globalized."
"Do you think that I don't know about the Internet?"
"Where do your shoes come from?"
"China, I suppose."
"I told people to seek Wisdom from as far away as China,"
"But I didn't tell them to go to China
"To buy their shoes."
"Either sit and peace and pray with me,"
"Or go on your way so I can pray in this cave in peace!"
Well,
I felt that the Prophet Mohammed
Had a valid point about Globalization and Chinese Shoes.
So, I sat and prayed with him,
But eventually, in the relaxing atmosphere
Of that cool, humid cave,
I fell asleep.
When I woke up,
The Prophet Mohammed was gone.
I wondered if I had actually seen him,
Or if I had experienced some sort of Hallucination.
Of course,
Differentiating between Reality and a Hallucination
Is just another Arbitrary Category.
I guess that's what the Prophet Mohammed
Was trying to tell me.
