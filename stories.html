<h3><b>Making My Way Down South…      By Helena Won</b></h3>


<p>
Thanksgiving has been a very old tradition in my family. It started when my parents celebrated their first Thanksgiving in America together, decades ago, and continues to this day. My siblings and I are living all over the world, but we always make it home to the USA by Thanksgiving.
My younger brother and I have a tradition where we take the city bus to a local arcade, play a few rounds of air hockey and then head home. Our mother is a stickler for details when it comes to Thanksgiving dinner and forces us to leave the house so she can get things ready, which is how we ended up at the arcade all those years ago.
I was born and raised in a very diverse environment. Our community was made up of people from all over the world including America, Korea, Japan, Bangladesh, and India to name a few, WIth such diversity, I never really saw Islamophobia or an type of bigotry growing up. After 9/11, however I was subjected to occasional racial and Islamophobic slurs.
Still, I loved my city because the people there were generally very tolerant. This Thanksgiving, I expected it to be no different than my previous years, but it seemed as if I was in for a rude awakening. My brother and I were ushered out of the house (as usual) and decided to hop on the bus and head to the arcade. 
The arcade owner knows us pretty  well, and usually greets us with a, “Mama kicked you guys out already?” My brother and I, in turn, simply nod and head over to the air hockey table. We talked about what we had been up to since last seeing each other, who we had met, and if there were any significant others in our lives. 
“Still single, Why’s it so hard to find a spouse?” My brother joked before deflecting the puck.
</p>

<p>
“It’s not too bad. A lot of our communities have cultural barriers which they don’t wish to cross. That’s what I think is the biggest contributing factor to Muslims being unable to find a decent spouse,” I commented before deflecting his strike.
“One religion. One brotherhood. Isn’t that how it’s supposed to be?” My brother asked with his head cocked to the side in skepticism. 
</p>

<p>
“Well if it were a perfect world, we wouldn’t have ware, we wouldn’t be xenophobic, and we wouldn’t treat Muslims from third-world countries as second class. It’s not a perfect world, bro,” I pointed out.
In hindsight, my words had foreshadowed my own upcoming experience. After losing the game by two points, I admitted defeat (much to my brother’s joy) and headed back to the bus stop. It was a little chilly, just the way Thanksgiving was supposed to be WIthin a few minutes, the bus stopped right in front of us and we embarked on our journey home. 
The bus was pretty packed and I knew it was because of the holiday schedule. We managed to dif seats near the back and hunkered down for our ride home.
</p>

<p>
“You ever think Mom and Dad raised us wrong?” My brother asked out of the blue.
</p>

<p>
“No. I think we were born in the wrong time. I’ve been called ‘too progressive’ by people in other countries,” I shrugged.
</p>

<p>
Before my brother could say whatever was on his mind, the bus stopped at it’s next destination. A pair of old ladies, the type of ladies that seem like they play Bridge on the regular, boarded the bus. My brother was the first to get up and offer his seat and naturally, I followed. The kind ladies thanked us and we decided to stand nect to them since there were literally no more seats left. The ladies began talking about whatever it was little old ladies talk about and I decided to zone out and watch the scenery. 
This is where it got a little weird. At our next stop, a man who looked to be of hispanic descent boarded the bus. He tipped his hat at the driver and headed towards the back of the bus. People shuffled out of his way and just as my brother and I were about to shift over, one of the little old ladies grabbed my arm. I looked at her in question and she whispered,
“Can you two just stay here? I don’t want no Muslim standing next to us. You never know which one of them will turn on us next.”
</p>

<p>
I was at a loss for words. My brother threw me a look of disbelief, his mouth hanging open, but quickly closed it once one of the ladies looked at him. The man wasn’t Muslim. He was wearing a gold crucifix. He simply had a long beard. My brother didn’t have a beard, but he was very Muslim. I didn’t wear a hijab, but so was I.
“Should I tell her?” My brother asked in a whisper as he leaned in close. I shook my head slightly and thanked God that our bus stop was next. This was my city. We didn’t have these types of people here, but in a second, two little old ladies changed my entire perspective.
