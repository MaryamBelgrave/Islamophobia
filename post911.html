<h2><b>Post 9/11</b></h2>

	 
<p>Islamophobia did not begin on 9/11. It has a long history in the United States and around the world that can be traced back as early as the colonial era when European settlers carried their antagonism to the New World. THroughout American history, Islamophobia extended just beyond the domestic sphere. Research shows that the US identified more than 160 Muslim-AMerican terrorism suspects and perpetrators in the decade since 9/11.</P> 
<p>After 9/11, Muslims were looked upon as terrorists. 15 years later, Muslims are wrongly accused of bombings and other acts of terrorism. Even though there have been attacks carried out by people twisting Islam, classifying all muslims as terrorists is completely stereotypical and absolutely false. Media coverage brings Muslim - American terrorism suspects to national attention, creating an impression  unintentionally  that Muslim
American terrorism is more widespread than it really is. “Such a mindset saw Islamophobic attacks increase by 1,700% in 2001. Prior to 9/11, the FBI recorded just 28 hate crimes against Muslims. The following year it increased to 481.”</p>


<p>Parts of the media contribute negatively the epidemic of Islamophobia we see today. Whenever there is a terror attack and the terrorist involved is a Muslim the media tend to accentuate that fact, shedding a negative impact on other Muslims.
It is usually misinformation or total lack of information based on the religion.Numerous events of terrorism involving Muslims causes more and more people to believe that muslims are terrorists</p>


<p>Discrimination has taken a toll on Muslim American communities. More hate-fueled incidents — from physical attacks, to the vandalizing of mosques to divisive rhetoric from presidential candidates  — are popping up every month.  Some Muslims are saying that Islamophobia is worse than it’s ever been.
Islamophobic attacks are at an all-time high. In London, the Metropolitan Police reported a 47 percent increase in the first ten months of 2015.</p>
<p>In the USA, CAIR recorded over 70 attacks on mosques in 2015, the highest number yet.The week after the Paris terror attacks, British organisation Tell MAMA, which monitors Islamophobic abuse, recorded 115 new cases alone.
Increasingly, Muslim women are bearing the brunt of the hate. Recent incidents on Muslim women have seen them pushed in front of oncoming trains; punched and kicked off buses; and attacked whilst collecting their children from school. And it's Muslim women who wear the hijab most at risk.</p>
