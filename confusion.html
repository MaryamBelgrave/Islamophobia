<h2>What's All The Confusion?</h2>
<p>Many people believe that Islam represents “hate” and “terrorism”. “For example, in the past Arabs and Muslims were largely recognized in the West as “erotic”, “primitive”, “ignorant”, “slave traders” among other many derogatory terms. Lately, the terms such as “terrorist”, “fundamentalist” and “blood-thirsty” are the terms that are over-generally ascribed to the Arabs and Muslims. “</p>
<p>Islam is none of the things that people in the West describe them as. The word “Islam” means”peace” itself.The word does not represent a one-sided relationship, where the believer is enslaved to Allah. Rather, the word Islam indicates a covenant between Allah and his followers, where a Muslim surrenders his or her will to Allah in return for peace or safety.</p>
